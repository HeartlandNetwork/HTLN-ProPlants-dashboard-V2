Problem

Need to sort out problem with HOME and HOSP parks - When you select data for HOME, you get records in HOSP showing up - This dataset (PBIX) was the working version created by Jeremy - The source of the data was from the draft invasive plants data package

Getting started

Need a copy of the draft data package - copy to src folder

What are the questions?

Why does HOSP display when you select HOME in the dashboard?
